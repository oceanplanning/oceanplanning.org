            <h3>Ocean planning</h3>
            <p>Ocean planning – a multi-stakeholder, data-driven process to understand what people want for the future of their oceans and to evaluate the trade-offs among their interests in a way that maximizes economic and ecological value - is increasingly being adopted by governments in the US and Canada and ocean stakeholders.  This map provides a window into the rise of this approach in ocean management in the US and Canada, the individual planning efforts underway and completed, and information about each effort.</p>

            <h3>United States</h3>
            <h4>More than 5% of US ocean waters are currently being planned or are already managed with ocean plans.</h4>

            <p>US oceans are home to a vast diversity of ecosystems, including the incredibly productive Gulf of Maine, majestic California kelp forests and the rich coral reefs of Hawaii.  Nearly matching this diversity is the array of activities carried out in the ocean by fishermen, shipping vessels, tourism businesses, recreational boaters, conservationists and wildlife advocates, scientists, energy industries, harbormasters, undersea cable companies and all others who enjoy and use the oceans.</p>

            <p>The current approach to managing activities in the ocean usually addresses the variety of demands on ocean space and resources one by one. This approach can lead to colliding interests, a lack of certainty for ocean industries, and failure to optimize ecological, social, and economic value.  In 2010, the US released its first National Ocean Policy to address this issue via a process called ocean planning to improve the long-term stewardship of America’s oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the practice of ocean planning has grown in use across the planet, and for good reason.  Like land-use planning, ocean planning can be used to improve decision-making and management, reduce user conflict, protect and conserve ocean wildlife and increase efficiency and performance in the use of public resources such as tax dollars and agency staff time. Ocean planning can yield benefits for coastal communities and ocean industries desiring attractive and healthy seascapes, a more certain regulatory framework and reduced conflicts with other ocean users.</p>

            <p>Ocean planning activities in the US are underway at all levels of government, from local to federal.  US states such as Oregon, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have developed comprehensive ocean plans for their state waters. The experience and practices of these state-based plans have greatly inspired and informed the development of the regional ocean planning processes under the National Ocean Policy.  In the US, the federal government manages activities in US ocean waters between 3 and 200 nautical miles (nm) from shore.  Planning for this large area (11.3 million km2, or 1.5 times the size of the continental US) is designed to occur in nine separate regions to address the management and stewardship issues most important to the ocean users and stakeholders in those regions. Though the ocean waters under federal management are distinct from the waters that coastal states control (0 – 3nm), by design, coordination among federal and state agencies is a vital part of the US’s approach ocean planning.</p>

            <h3>Canada</h3>
            <h4>More than 28% of Canadian ocean waters are currently being planned or are already managed with ocean plans.</h4>

            <p>Canadian oceans are home to a magnificent diversity of ecosystems, from the kelp forests of British Columbia to the polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice) of Lancaster Sound.  Nearly matching this diversity is the array of activities carried out in the ocean by fishermen, First Nations and Inuit subsistence hunters, shipping vessels, tourism businesses, recreational boaters, conservationists and wildlife advocates, scientists, energy industries, harbormasters, undersea cable companies, and all others who want to enjoy and use the oceans.</p>

            <p>The current approach to managing activities in the ocean usually addresses the variety of demands on ocean space and resources one-by-one, which can lead to colliding interests, a lack of certainty for ocean industries and failure to optimize ecological, social, and economic value.  In 1997, Canada became the first country in the world to address this issue with legislation, the Oceans Act, mandating integrated ocean management.  The Act called for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to “lead and facilitate the development and implementation of plans for the integrated management of all activities or measures in or affecting estuaries, coastal waters and marine waters...”  What resulted were some of the world’s earliest efforts to apply ocean planning tools and processes to maintain the health of Canada’s oceans while maximizing their sustainable use.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the practice of ocean planning has grown in use across the planet, and for good reason.  Like land-use planning, ocean planning can be used to improve decision-making and management, reduce user conflict, protect and conserve ocean wildlife, and increase performance and efficiency in the use of public resources such as tax dollars and agency staff time. Ocean planning can yield benefits for coastal communities and ocean industries who want attractive and healthy seascapes, a more certain regulatory framework and reduced conflicts with other ocean users.</p>

            <p>Aboriginal, Provincial, Territorial, and Federal governments have various degrees of jurisdiction over the many activities that take place in Canadian waters.  Thus, planning for this large area (7.1 million km2, or 70% the size of its land mass) takes shared objective-setting and broader coordination among the different levels of government.  Several First Nations governments, working with provincial government agencies in British Columbia have developed comprehensive ocean plans for their waters. This experience has illustrated that governments working together and with stakeholders is an effective route to generating ocean plans in Canada. It has also shown that ocean plans produce a mosaic of use and conservation that can put coastal communities and the ocean resources on which they depend on a trajectory for a healthy future.</p>
